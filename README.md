# ConsoleMusicPlayer
When running the program you first have to select a playlist. By default there is a 'all' playlist which plays all
music from the music/ folder. If you like, you can add a playlist to data/. In a playlist (.pl) file in each
line is the filename (e.g. myMusic.mp3) of a music file (which has to be in music/). Note: PlaylistEditor is comming.
If multiple playlists are displayed, then select them with the arrow keys or by typing the displayed number. Afterwards
just press Enter and the playlist runs. In this mode you can press [I] to see all available key commands.
Enjoy!
